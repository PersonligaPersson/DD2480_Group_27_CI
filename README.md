# Continuous Integration

A project repository for group 27 for lab 2 of the course DD2480 at KTH. The task is to implement a _continuous integration_ (CI) server.

The CI server works for Python projects and performs the following tasks every time the project is updated:

- Does a static syntax check on the Python code
- Executes automated tests on the Python program
- Informs the project members on the build results by updating commit statuses in the repo
- Saves the history of past builds, where each build history can be accessed through a separate URL

# Getting Started

## Linting the application

In order to lint the application, run the command:

```
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py') --rcfile=./config/.pylintrc
```

This lints the project using our custom rc-file.

## Virtual environment

Create a virtual environment that the application can be run inside using the command,

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
```

## Install Dependencies

To install dependencies run,

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Adding a dependency

If you add a dependency while developing then you need to issue the command,

```bash
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

to add it to the manifest file.

## Running the application

To run the application simply issue the command,

```bash
$ python run.py
```

And the server will start up on `localhost:8080`

# Contributions

We worked in a similar manner to the previous assignment. In other words, we divided up the tasks roughly equally among us. All of us contributed to the reviewing of pull requests and we communicated on a daily basis. The communication took place over meetings, our Discord chat and comments in the repo. The meetings helped us make sure the work was running smoothly.
