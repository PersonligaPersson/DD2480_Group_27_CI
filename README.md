# Continuous Integration

A project repository for group 27 for lab 2 of the course DD2480 at KTH. The task is to implement a _continuous integration_ (CI) server.

The CI server works for Python projects and performs the following tasks every time the project is updated:

- Does a static syntax check on the Python code
- Executes automated tests on the Python program
- Informs the project members on the build results by updating commit statuses in the repo
- Saves the history of past builds, where each build history can be accessed through a separate URL

The flow chart below illustrates the interaction between Github and the CI server:
